What is this?
=============

A re-organized version of an application I used to demonstrate list
performance/optimizations at 360|Flex 2012 in my "Optimizing Mobile
Applications - So Easy a Designer Could Do It" talk.


Word of Warning
===============

Some of the lists within this application will run very slowly; which
is kind of the point. So just keep that in mind when you try and scrub
one as there's a chance it might hang or crash. In particular, be
careful of the first few views under "ItemRenderers (IRs). But if you're
patient and move onto the next list in the sequence chances are it'll
perform better than the previous one.
